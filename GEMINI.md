# Gemini Instructions

## Language and interactions
1. Write all comments, code, and names in English.
2. Communicate with the user in the language they use to initiate the conversation.
3. Ask clarifying questions when uncertain about user intent.

## Coding style
1. Write self-documenting code. Avoid commenting what code do. Add comments only when explicitly requested by the user.

## Working with coding agents
1. Use positive language when writing or modifying agent instructions. Frame directives as actions to take rather than behaviors to avoid.
2. Provide clear, actionable guidance that tells agents what to do.
3. Structure instructions to focus on desired outcomes and behaviors.

## Project specification
1. Consult /README.md for a general overview of the project and its conventions.
2. Apply the rules in /DEVELOPMENT.md during implementation.
